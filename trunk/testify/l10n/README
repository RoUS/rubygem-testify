This tree contains the libraries of localised text, and the source
files used to create them.

Libraries are named {lang}.ldb, such as "en.ldb", and the source files
for a particular language are found in the directory with the same
name.  For example, the source files for English (considered the
master sources on which the other localised files should be based) are
in the "en/" subdirectory.

Source files are suffixed with ".l10n" and customarily contain one
item per file.  However, the mkl10n.pl script doesn't really care;
multiple localisations can exist in a particular file, or they could
all be in one big file.

The content of a .l10n file is treated as follows:

* Lines with a first non-whitespace character of '#' are treated as
  comments and ignored;
* Lines beginning with '&' in column 1 are the keys for which
  localised text is being provided.  These keys are what are looked up
  with the L10n Perl module.
* All other lines are considered the localisation text for the most
  recently read key.

That last point bears thinking about; since the mkl10n.pl script
doesn't care about file boundaries, it is possible for text in one
file to be considered part of the localisation for a key in a file
previously read.  For this reason it is STRONGLY recommended that the
first non-comment line of all .l10n files be a '&key' definition line.

The libraries are built by the mkl10n.pl script.  The Makefile will
apply it to all languages found in the tree.
