Filter attributes:

 o Is it a Perl script or something else?  (Only Perl at first)
 o Does it read every line itself (while <>) or does it act on one line
   at a time (perl -p)?
 o What's its name?
 o What's its filename?
 o Where is it located?
 o What termination sentinel string should it be sent, if any?

Other notes:

 o Configuration needs to be abstracted so the storage can be
   a text file or db of some sort.
 o The config stuff could possibly benefit from the PHP stuff
   I did for Damia.
 o The command parser needs to be more generalised, and made able
   to handle things like 'add test -f -g -h foo'.
