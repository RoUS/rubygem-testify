For a new test:

1. Create a test, define prologue, filters, epilogue
2. Run test
3. Verify that output is as desired (lather, rinse, repeat)
4. Commit output as benchmark.

Running an existing test (i.e., validating new code levels):

1. Run prologue
2. Run test
3. Run epilogue
4. Run filters
5. Compare to the benchmark\
6. Report success or else show differences

o Changed output needs to be committable as the new benchmark.
o Old benchmarks need to be retained and addressable in order to
  be able to test updates to older branches.

o Multiple tests need to be assemblable into a group or suite, and run
  as a unit.
